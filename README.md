## Overview
This repository implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) deep learning model for transliterating English text into Devanagari script. The model learns to map sequences of characters from the English language to their corresponding sequences in Devanagari.

## Features
- Seq2Seq architecture with an encoder-decoder framework.
- Attention mechanism for improved transliteration accuracy.
- Easy-to-train model using custom datasets.
- Modular and extensible codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.8 or above
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (depending on implementation)
- A GPU (optional but recommended for faster training)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kushalsathe123/Transliteration_deep_learning.git
   cd Transliteration_deep_learning


2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
###Usage
 1. Prepare your dataset. The dataset should include English-Devanagari pairs in a suitable format.
 2. Train the model:
```bash
python train.py --data_path <path_to_dataset> --output_path <path_to_save_model>
```
 3. Test the model:
```bash
python test.py --model_path <path_to_model> --input_text <text>
```
###Model Architecture
The transliteration model uses a Seq2Seq architecture with an encoder-decoder framework:

 * Encoder: Processes the input English text and encodes it into a fixed-length context vector.
 * Decoder: Decodes the context vector to generate the output in Devanagari script.
 * Attention Mechanism: Helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during transliteration.
###Results
 * Accuracy: Add your results here after testing the model.
 * Example Outputs:
    **Input: namaste
    **Output: नमस्ते
